                <p class="p1"><span>H</span>ello World! I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a focus on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Node.js. My passion for coding was ignited in me some months ago when a friend introduced me to an online Java course, and since then, I have been constantly studying and taking classes to develop my skills. I am highly committed to honing my skills, ant that is why I devote all my free time, including lunch breaks and daily commute, to implementing new techniques and approaches to develop sophisticated, interactive web applications.
                </p>
                <p class="p2"><span>I</span> always carry with me my pc and always trying to improve my knowledge through web articles, classes and videos.

                    Currently, I am working full-time in a completely different field while also pursuing my aspiration of becoming a web developer and JavaScript expert. My ultimate goal is to become a Full Stack Developer and develop my own in-browser multiplayer game. 
                    Always looking for new opportunities to keep growing and a career that would help me further develop my skills.</p>
